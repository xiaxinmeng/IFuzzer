# Plain text comments are comments with natural language sentences.
# PEP 8 also says comment text should begin with a capital letter and end with '.'.
# Such comments are not Python code and removal of the '#' would create syntax errors.

# Commented out code blocks are lines of code deleted from compilation
# but not from the file.  Usually the intent is to undelete in the future.
# Such code blocks may contain normal comments.  Even more reason for the double hash.

##if a and b:  # Normal comment about this code.
##   c = frobulate(a, b)   # Slow.
